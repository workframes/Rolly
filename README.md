> **What is it?**
* This module is made to interact with the [Roliomons](https://www.rolimons.com/) API. Easy to use, It's lightweight meaning it will not take much memory in your game so your game will still run very smoothly.

> **What Does it Include?**

* It uses [roblox-promises](https://eryn.io/roblox-lua-promise/) to make sure that everything is handled smoothly especially the `GET` request to the API.

* It also uses a Cache system to store necessary data, so the module doesn't have to spam request the API, however, the Cache does refresh every 300 seconds or 5 minutes.

* Currently it only supports the following endpoints

+ https://www.rolimons.com/api/playerassets/
+ https://www.rolimons.com/itemapi/itemdetails
+ https://www.rolimons.com/api/activity

> **How do I get it?**
* Simply get the model from roblox.
